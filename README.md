✈️ Flight Delay Prediction with Machine Learning

📝 Overview
Flight delays can cause significant inconvenience to passengers and disruptions to airline operations. This project utilizes Machine Learning to predict the delay in flight arrivals based on a variety of factors such as weather, traffic, and crew availability. The goal is to build a robust model using PyTorch that can help airlines proactively manage potential delays.

🚀 Features
Predict flight delays based on departure time, weather conditions, crew availability, and more.
Use PyTorch to build a Neural Network model for accurate predictions.
Evaluate model performance with Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) metrics.
Dataset includes real-world factors that influence flight delays, such as:
Departure and arrival times
Departure and arrival locations
Weather conditions (bad weather or not)
Traffic congestion
Crew availability issues




🧑‍💻 Technologies Used
PyTorch: For building and training the neural network.
Scikit-learn: For data preprocessing, scaling, and train-test splitting.
Pandas: For handling the dataset.
Jupyter Notebook: For development and analysis.
🔍 Results
The model predicts flight delays with an average error of about 51 minutes as measured by the RMSE. This model can be further improved by adding more features, fine-tuning hyperparameters, or incorporating more sophisticated architectures.

⚙️ Future Improvements
Use more advanced models like Gradient Boosting or LSTM for sequential data.
Incorporate additional features like flight duration, day of the year, and holiday schedules.
Fine-tune the neural network with better hyperparameters and more hidden layers.
